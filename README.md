# Fun with Angular Elements - ESRI Mapping Component  

This is a proof of concept developed to see if pure web components could be generated from a functional web mapping application. The application was built with [Angular](https://angular.io/) and the [ESRI JavaScript api](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/), and the componets were created using [Angular Elements](https://angular.io/guide/elements). The general idea is to be able create web components (with modern tooling)  that can be dropped into any website, without the baggage the ESRI JavaScript api or any other dependencies, kinda like this:

This is very much a WIP. Road map items include:
- make responsive 
- unit tests
- more web components
